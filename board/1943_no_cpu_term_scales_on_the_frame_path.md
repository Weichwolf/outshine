# Nothing on the frame path scales with geometry, lights or pixels on the CPU

**Benchmark** — Unreal: the same answer as 1926 for the whole frame path, not only lights. RAGE: per-batch. **Taking Unreal**.

This is the area where the distance to both benchmarks is largest. Unreal drives its passes from
`FGPUScene`: instances live in GPU buffers, culling runs in compute, and the draw is indirect --
the CPU issues one call for a pass, not one per batch. Lights are assigned to clusters in a
compute pass and the shading stage reads the grid. RAGE is reconstructed and less certain, but
its drawlists are likewise fed from resident buffers.

outshine issues a uniform push per batch, twice per frame.

- [x] the tone chain is checkable end to end against a closed form, so a factor of two cannot
      hide in it

**THE GEOMETRY HALF OF THIS INVARIANT IS BUILT IN board:1989**, which carries the measurement,
the five mechanisms of a GPU-driven path, the seven-step route and its oracles. This item keeps
the RULE; that one keeps the work. What stays here is everything the rule covers that is not
geometry: lights, shadows, the queries the frame makes, and the distribution it publishes.

- [ ] the shadow pass issues ONE indirect draw from the resident instance buffer, not one
      `PushGPUVertexUniformData` per batch (board:1926)
- [ ] lights are assigned to clusters or tiles by a compute stage, and `kMaxSubjectLights` stops
      being the light budget (board:1926)
- [ ] the shadow atlas carries cascades and the shader picks one (board:1926)
- [ ] the shadow centre folds INSTANCE bounds, not every vertex (board:1926)
- [ ] no query the frame path makes blocks, allocates, locks or touches disk (board:1937)
- [ ] the frame publishes p50/p95/p99 over a moving camera, not a mean (board:1457)
- [ ] geometry carries its own detail ladder and the pool holding it is a slot table
      (board:1512)
