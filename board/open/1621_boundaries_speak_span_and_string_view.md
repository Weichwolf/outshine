# Boundaries speak span and string_view

Every read-only boundary that today takes `const std::vector<T>&` or `const std::string&`
takes `std::span<const T>` / `std::string_view` instead, and no call site copies into an
owning container just to traverse. Owner directive 2026-08-22; the architecture reviewer's
mechanical bar enforces it on every touched file from now on — this item is the sweep over
the existing tree.

Survey first (`grep -rn 'const std::vector<.*> &\|const std::string &' src/ include/`),
convert layer by layer, fast gate green per layer. `[[nodiscard]]`, `explicit`, `noexcept`
and `constexpr` hygiene ride the same sweep where the touched signature is missing them.

Enabling move landed: the whole tree builds C++20 (one CXXSTD; gate 122/122 warm in 52 s).
First conversion: the Fit family (Simplify, Fit, KeepBetween, AwayFromChordM) takes
std::span<const double> -- callers convert implicitly, zero churn. Survey: 98 vector-ref and
76 string-ref boundary parameters remain, layer by layer.

Reviewer sharpening (2026-08-22, evening round) -- three residues of this hour's own sweep:
- src/ground/TileWatermark.h:59 `Done(const std::vector<OsmField::Feature> &)` kept the
  vector ref while Ask and Advance beside it went span -- half-converted class.
- src/core/io/Log.h: only Info gained a span overload; Debug/Warn/Error still take
  initializer_list alone, so a caller holding a built field array can only log at Info.
- src/core/io/Log.cpp:39-44 (Emit): under an active LogUnitScope every log call still
  allocates the withUnit vector -- 40d99ce's "the allocation is gone" holds only for the
  unit-less path. Prepend the unit field sink-side or on a fixed-capacity buffer.
