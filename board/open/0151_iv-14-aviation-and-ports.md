**IV.14 Aviation and ports**

---
## Band V — Vehicles
*GTA 5 names the construction: a vehicle is a hull on wheels with suspension, tyre grip and a torque
curve; a human is a capsule whose locomotion the animation leads. The field groups below follow RAGE's
own `handling.meta` division — mass and aero, drivetrain, brakes and steering, traction, suspension,
damage — because it is the published enumeration of what a driveable body needs. **Nothing in this band
exists.** It depends on I.12 in full.*

**Acceptance, shared by every child**: done = a render case exists in `test/khronos/glTF/` for this type, cites its `board:NNNN`, and is within the picture bound (`CLAUDE.md`).

**Cost of the full sweep**: about 858 x 8.17 s of Blender, roughly two hours, so the corpus is built once and cached rather than re-rendered.

**Retention**: after validation both `outshine.raw` and `oracle.raw` are deleted; `oracle.exr` and the two PNGs are kept. About 1.4 MB a case against 25 GB today.
